* Steins;Zapp D-Mailer
It's hard to announce that, after 2 years of development, this project will be terminated and closed here. The two main reasons are:

1. The Steins;Zapp base apk (~com.soula2~) isn't updated very often: everyone who uses Steins;Zapp can't use it for a long period due to the lack of updates (WhatsApp obliges you to use it always in the latest version); and
2. WhatsApp keeps *offuscating* and *bloating* its own code in *EVERY SINGLE UPDATE*: this makes the Steins;Zapp updates nearly *impossible* to do and maintain;

Some day a Steins;Zapp "descendent" may be developed, but this isn't a promise. We apologize and we hope this project was so important to you as it was for us.
